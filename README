BetterTransit is an iOS framework which retrieves and displays real-time bus arrival times. The framework is designed to be easily extendable to all kinds of real-time bus information systems. So far this framework has been successfully integrated with three different real-time bus systems in the United States and Singapore.

In the spirit of sharing and improving public transit systems, this framework is now released to all developers under the MIT license. I will keep updating this framework and contributions are welcome as well.
